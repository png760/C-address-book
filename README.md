A lightweight and minimalistic addressbook written in C. Very WIP, I do not plan on working on this much. Simple functions such as creating new contacts are included but not yet refined.
Type "help" for a list of commands. This is my first project, and I am only playing around with libraries.


Installation: (for linux) \
`git clone https://github.com/png760/C-address-book.git` \
`gcc - o addressbook addressbook.c` \
`chmod +x addressbook`\
`./addressbook`\

I do not plan on adding support for windows.
It should create the contacts file for you. Adjust the script to your liking.
